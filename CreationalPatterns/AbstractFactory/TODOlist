As far as now, we have implemented the "basic" version of the CommonClasses.Maze, within the following classes:
- CommonClasses.Direction (enum)                                                                              [X]
- CommonClasses.Door                                                                                          [X]
- CommonClasses.MapSite                                                                                       [X]
- CommonClasses.Maze                                                                                          [X]
- CommonClasses.MazeFactory                                                                                   [X]
- CommonClasses.MazeGame                                                                                      [X]
- CommonClasses.Room                                                                                          [X]
- CommonClasses.Wall                                                                                          [X]
                                                                                                [Status: DONE]


CommonClasses.MazeFactory is either the AbstractFactory and the ConcreteFactor, because it was implemented as a concrete class within all the
factory methods for instantiate a CommonClasses.Door,a CommonClasses.Maze,a CommonClasses.Room and a CommonClasses.Wall.

We are now interested on creating enchanted mazes within:
- CommonClasses.Spell                                                                                         [X]
- CommonClasses.EnchantedRoom                                                                                 [X]
- CommonClasses.DoorNeedingSpell                                                                              [X]
- CommonClasses.EnchantedMazeGame                                                                             [X]
- CommonClasses.EnchantedMazeFactory                                                                          [X]
                                                                                                [Status: DONE]

Finally, suppose we want to make a maze game in which a rom can have a bomb set in it.
Classes to be developed:
- CommonClasses.BombedWall                                                                                    [X]
- CommonClasses.RoomWithABomb                                                                                 [X]
- CommonClasses.BombedMazeGame                                                                                [X]
- CommonClasses.BombedMazeFactory                                                                             [X]
- Bomb (can be a boolean variable - true if it is within the room either false - or an object)  [X]
                                                                                                [Status: DONE]
