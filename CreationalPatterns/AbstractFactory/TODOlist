As far as now, we have implemented the "basic" version of the Maze, within the following classes:
- Direction (enum)                                                                              [X]
- Door                                                                                          [X]
- MapSite                                                                                       [X]
- Maze                                                                                          [X]
- MazeFactory                                                                                   [X]
- MazeGame                                                                                      [X]
- Room                                                                                          [X]
- Wall                                                                                          [X]
                                                                                                [Status: DONE]


MazeFactory is either the AbstractFactory and the ConcreteFactor, because it was implemented as a concrete class within all the
factory methods for instantiate a Door,a Maze,a Room and a Wall.

We are now interested on creating enchanted mazes within:
- Spell                                                                                         [X]
- EnchantedRoom                                                                                 [X]
- DoorNeedingSpell                                                                              [X]
- EnchantedMazeGame                                                                             [X]
- EnchantedMazeFactory                                                                          [X]
                                                                                                [Status: DONE]

Finally, suppose we want to make a maze game in which a rom can have a bomb set in it.
Classes to be developed:
- BombedWall                                                                                    [X]
- RoomWithABomb                                                                                 [X]
- BombedMazeGame                                                                                [X]
- BombedMazeFactory                                                                             [X]
- Bomb (can be a boolean variable - true if it is within the room either false - or an object)  [X]
                                                                                                [Status: DONE]
